# FEASIBILITY CHECKS FOR THE OPTIMIZATION OF THE MATCHING IN DIAL-A-RIDE PROBLEM WITH NO PRE-BOOKING

## Description

Provide a brief description of what your project does, what problem it solves, or what it's about.

During my undergraduate studies at Ecole Polythecnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), I was tasked with working on a project for an entire semester. The aim of this project was to propose a functional algorithm that enables shared trips with up to two passengers in one vehicle simultaneously. The study involved two models, and their outcomes and performances were compared to determine which model was more efficient. To evaluate the algorithms, a simulation was carried out, intentionally designed to be pseudorandom, to repeat the simulation for different constraint values such as maximum waiting and detour time, percentage of passengers willing to share, etc., and observe their variations.

The PDF file of this project is also uploaded in this repository. You are welcome to read it to gain a better understanding of the content.
